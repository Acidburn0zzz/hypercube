# Hypercube: prototype implementation of a concept for a modern browser's user interface

Hypercube is the result of a [bachelor thesis titled "Conception and prototyping of a modern browser's user interface"][bachelorthesis]. It is a JavaScript-based prototype used for visualizing ideas expressed in the concept which are:

- the browser in the background
- a different approach to bookmark management
- focus on navigation

Limitations and other important information about the prototype can be found in the [bachelor thesis][bachelorthesis]. While previous versions were running as a Chrome Extension and a Chrome App, the most recent ones can run as a stand-alone application based on [node-webkit][nw].
